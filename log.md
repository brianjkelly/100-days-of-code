# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 21, Wednesday
#####

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS and responsiveness in portfolio, worked on content of resume. Read Chapter 1 of CTCI book and reviewed Big O notation.

**Thoughts:** Doing real projects versus tutorials is going to be a real challenge but only an hour a day makes it feel very obtainable. I have been working on code every day since bootcamp ended but excited to officially get started.

### Day 2: October 22, Thursday
#####

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up layout of retro game collector and create repository on github to store.

**Thoughts**: I struggle with CSS, but, especially after spending a lot of time in my portfolio website, I am definitely getting better at it. Thinking I will have more days closer to the 1-2 hour of project work this first week because data structures and technical interview questions are at the forefront of my mind

### Day 3: October 23, Friday
#####

**Today's Progress**: Added accessories to retro game collector and the ability to associate them with a game. Added accessories to the game detail page.

**Thoughts**: It has been really tough balancing time and shifting gears between data structures and technical interview question work and actual project work. Moving forward, I plan on deciding exactly what projects and what studying I will be doing at least 1 day in advance to aid in focus.

### Day 4: October 24, Saturday
#####

**Today's Progress**: Today I focused primarily on linked lists for technical interview questions. I did clean up some functionality in my portfolio as well in regards to the passing of props for the carousel on my website.

**Thoughts**: Today was a tough day after a late start. Tomorrow will be another challenge to get my coding in coupled with my other daily goals (workout, meditation, and reading) because of NFL so I have structured my day around the NFL games and will get my workouts in beforehand and coding in the evening.
