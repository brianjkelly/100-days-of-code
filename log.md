# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 21, 2020
#####

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS and responsiveness in portfolio, worked on content of resume. Read Chapter 1 of CTCI book and reviewed Big O.

**Thoughts:** Doing real projects versus tutorials is going to be a real challenge but only an hour a day makes it feel very obtainable. I have been working on code every day since bootcamp ended but excited to officially get started.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
